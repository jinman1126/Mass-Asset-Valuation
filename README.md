# Mass-Asset-Valuation
Valuing companies on a large scale can be difficult. Luckily, you can use data from daily returns and dividends in order to run an options-based valuation. This program is designed to use an options-based valuation approach and implement it for any symbol in a list (i.e. an exchange or the S&amp;P 500).
